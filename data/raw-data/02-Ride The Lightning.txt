ride-the-lightning| 1| Fight Fire With Fire| "Do unto others as they have done unto you But what in the hell is this world coming to? Blow the universe into nothingness Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest Fight fire with fire Ending is near Fight fire with fire Bursting with fear We all shall die Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast Armageddon is here, like said in the past Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death The gods are laughing, so take your last breath"
ride-the-lightning| 2| Ride The Lightning| "Guilty as charged But damn it, it ain't right There is someone else controlling me Death in the air Strapped in the electric chair This can't be happening to me Who made you God to say I'll take your life from you! Flash before my eyes Now it's time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Wait for the sign To flick the switch of death It's the beginning of the end Sweat, chilling cold As I watch death unfold Consciousness my only friend My fingers grip with fear What I am doing here? Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don't want to die Time moving slowly The minutes seem like hours The final curtain call I see How true is this? Just get it over with If this is true, just let it be Wakened by the horrid scream Freed from the frightening dream"
ride-the-lightning| 3| For Whom The Bell Tolls| "Make his fight on the hill in the early day Constant chill deep inside Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey On they fight, for the right, yes but who's to say? For a hill men would kill why? They do not know Stiffened wounds test their pride Men of five, still alive through the raging glow Gone insane from this pain that they surely know For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls Take a look to the sky just before you die It is the last time you will Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery He hears the silence so loud Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls"
ride-the-lightning| 4| Fade To Black| "Life it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can't be real Cannot stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filing me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now He's gone No one but me can save myself, but it's too late Now I can't think, think why I should even try Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye"
ride-the-lightning| 5| Trapped Under Ice| "I don't know how to live trough this hell Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell Frozen soul, frozen down to the core Break the ice, I can't take anymore Freezing Can't move at all Screaming Can't hear my call I am dying to live Cry out I'm trapped under the ice Crystallized, as I lay here and rest Eyes of glass stare directly at death From deep sleep I have broken away No one knows, no one hears what I say Freezing Can't move at all Screaming Can't hear my call I am dying to live Cry out I'm trapped under the ice Scream from my soul Fate, mystified Hell, forever more No release from my cryonic state What is this? I've been stricken by fate Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free Hand of doom has a tight grip on me Freezing Can't move at all Screaming Can't hear my call I am dying to live Cry out I'm trapped under the ice"
ride-the-lightning| 6| Escape| "Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy I know I'm my best friend No one cares, but I'm so much stronger I'll fight until the end To escape from the true false world Undamaged destiny Can't get caught in the endless circle Ring of stupidity Out of my own, out to be free One with my mind, they just can't see No need to hear things that they say Life is for my own to live my own way Rape my mind and destroy my feelings Don't tell my what to do I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side And I can see through you Feed my brain with your so called standards Who says that I ain't right Break away from your common fashion See through your blurry sight Out of my own, out to be free One with my mind, they just can't see No need to hear things that they say Life is for my own to live my own way See they try to bring the hammer down No damn chains can hold me to the ground Life is for my own to live my own way"
ride-the-lightning| 7| Creeping Death| "Slaves Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh Heed To his every word, live in fear Faith Of the unknown one, the deliverer Wait Something must be done, four hundred years So let it be written So let it be done I'm sent here by the chosen one So let it be written So let it be done To kill the first born pharaoh son I'm creeping death Now Let my people go, land of goshen Go I will be with thee, bush of fire Blood Running red and strong, down the Nile Plague Darkness three days long, hail to fire So let it be written So let it be done I'm sent here by the chosen one So let it be written So let it be done To kill the first born pharaoh son I'm creeping death Die by my hand I creep across the land Killing first born man Die by my hand I creep across the land Killing first born man I Rule the midnight air the destroyer Born I shall soon be there, deadly mass I Creep the steps and flood final darkness Blood Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass So let it be written So let it be done I'm sent here by the chosen one So let it be written So let it be done To kill the first born pharaoh son I'm creeping death"
